1. Start up your Pi to the terminal prompt. 
2. Type the following command 
sudo apt-get install xrdp
3. If promoted enter your password (the default is "raspberry")
4. Type "Y" and press enter.

This is now installing xrdp onto your Pi which is the software we are going to use for the remote desktop connection. Wait for it to complete.

5. Restart your Pi. We are going to check that xrdp is going to start up automatically.
6. When your Pi has booted to the command prompt look for [ ok ] Starting Remote Desktop Protocol server : xrdp sesman.
This shows you that xrdp is installed and automatically starting up on start up of your Pi
